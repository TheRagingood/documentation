Standard File is a sync and encryption library for web and native applications. It allows developers to focus on building great user-facing applications, and leaves the syncing, servers, and end-to-end encryption to our framework.

To build a quality application, most app developers today have to implement not only their own front-end clients, but also a backend architecture to handle model storage for their specific schema. With the growing trend of 'experimental' and 'single-use' applications, it becomes impractical to build a new server infrastructure for every application.

Standard File is a reusable client and server system that allows you to deploy a "dumb" backend server that doesn't know or care about your data schema, and allows you to encrypt data on the client-side and sync it with the remote server.

Standard File makes use of progressions in consumer device performance and capacity to enable end-to-end encryption on every platform. One can build any sort of secure and private application with a Standard File server, such as an [ encrypted notes app like Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org), or any sort of todo or personal data app.
