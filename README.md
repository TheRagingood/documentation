# Getting Started

To get started, [download Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/downloads/all) for your platform.

If you're tech savvy, you can even [host your own Standard File server](/standard-file).

# Extensions

To keep the core application as simple and as uncluttered as possible, Standard Notes allows for the installation of arbitrary extensions. These extensions are URL based, and anyone can build an extension.

Extensions are simple yet extremely powerful. Extensions allow for things like:
- 3rd party data sync
- Revision control
- Publishing your notes to your blog

For example, you may want your notes and tags to be synced to your Dropbox for added redundancy and peace of mind. Extensions make this really easy.

For a list of available extensions, see [extensions](https://standardnotes.org/extensions).

# Open Source

The Standard Notes ecosystem is [100% open source](https://github.com/standardnotes), including [this documentation](https://github.com/standardnotes/documentation)! This means anyone is free to improve upon or inspect the code and make sure it's not doing anything you wouldn't want it to do.

And because the Standard File specification is [openly published](https://github.com/standardfile), anyone can build their own Standard Notes app (client) or server. Neither you nor your notes are locked in to Standard Note's suite of applications. It's not something we consider often, but odds are, you as a human will outlive most of the private services you rely on today to manage your data. By building on top of a more open format, Standard Notes users don't have to worry about what would happen if Standard Notes got run over by a bus.

# FAQ

**How do you know you'll be here for a while?**

What makes software difficult to maintain is a growing feature set that constantly introduces a myriad of bugs and stability issues. Because we're committed to "freezing" our feature set as-is, the only maintenance work required is OS level compliance updates every year. While this is still a non-zero amount of work, it is far more manageable than a typical software project that aims to grow and grow every year. Because we're also not interested in "scaling", our costs should remain relatively low and allow us to sustain these applications for an extended period of time, if not indefinitely.
